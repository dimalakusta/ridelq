                <p class="main-p2">App based, ride sharing transportation providers such as Lyft, Curb, Hale, et. al, and of course Uber the massive, omnipresent ride-sharing<br> company, has dominated the industry since its inception in 2009. It has spread to more than 60 countries since then, and was recently valued <br> at $51 billion, spurring increasing talks of the company filing for an IPO. </p>

                    The idea, one platform that will gives you the expense or readiness based choice by quoting typical prices from many <br> competing on-demand services for their rides. One app that displays competing quotes, organized by cost vs. time of arrival <br> to the originating location.

                    Many fleets have one way trips and their cars return empty, this approach will give them a chance to bid on <br> offers that make sense.

After bidding is “closed”, <br> users will be still presented with an option of choosing from all companies based on $ and ETA for the <br> desired destination.

                <p class="product-p1">The idea of this platform is to create a customer App that will give people a choice of getting a ride <br> from many competitors based on $ vs ETA. This platform also will give the customer an option to <br> open bid for their trip. For example:</p>
                <p class="product-p2">I’m at AIRPORT and need to go to DOWNTOWN ; I select my FROM and TO and enter the price <br> I’m willing to spend for that trip.</p>
                <p class="product-p3">App will show a suggested price based on lowest historical average for that route. Let’s say <br> suggested price is $55, but I’m entering my “wish price” of $35. This gives companies a chance to <br> bid on this offer if they have available cars at the same destination.</p>

                    As is often the case, the genesis of MoveAround Pro (M.A.P.) ( <br> www.movearoundpro.com ) was inspired by the recognition of an unfilled <br> marketplace need which, in the course of their industry experiences, was <br> identified by the founders. That need - the development of a fully mobile, cloud <br> based solution for app based car fleets - was the seed that gave birth to M.A.P.
